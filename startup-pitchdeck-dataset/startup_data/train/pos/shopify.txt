Although we believe that the plans, intentions, expectations, assumptions and strategies reÔ¨Çected in these forward-looking statements are  reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future Ô¨Ånancial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors  that  may  cause  our  actual  results  to  be  materially  diÔ¨Äerent  from  any  future  results  expressed  or  implied  by  these  forward-looking  statements.  Although  the  forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, investors are cautioned against placing  undue reliance on these statements since actual results may vary from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown  risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially aÔ¨Äect our results. These risks are described in  further detail in the section entitled ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù and elsewhere in our Ô¨Ålings with regulatory agencies. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if  our  underlying  assumptions  prove  to  be  incorrect,  actual  results  may  vary  signiÔ¨Åcantly  from  those  implied  or  projected  by  the  forward-looking  statements.  References  to  long-term  trends  in  our  model  are  forward-looking  and  made  as  of  the  current  date.  Nothing  in  this  presentation  should  be  regarded  as  a  representation by any person that these long- term trends will be achieved and we undertake no duty to update its long-term trends.    We believe that the case studies presented in this presentation provide a representative sample of how our merchants have been able to use various features of  our platform to grow their respective businesses. References in this presentation to increased visits, growth and sales following implementation of our platform do  not necessarily mean that our platform was the only factor contributing to such increases.    To supplement the Ô¨Ånancial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use non-GAAP Ô¨Ånancial measures that  exclude certain items. Non-GAAP Ô¨Ånancial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other  companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
