Unfortunately, many companies  are unable to extract value and insight from their  data. AI will change that, and deep learning is at  the forefront of AI. With production-grade deep  learning tools, enterprise teams can learn from  their data more quickly, responding to the world  in real-time.  TURNING  DATA  INTO VALUE  Recent  breakthroughs in big data analysis and  AI  have  improved  our  ability  to  build  neural  networks  that  can  process  massive  amounts  of raw and unlabeled data. Because of this, we  can  achieve  accuracy  higher  than  ever  before,  a  revolution  that  will  sweep  across  many  industries.  Year  after  year,  deep  learning  is  pushing AI into new territory, breaking accuracy  records and leading to new products.  ‚Äú  3   DEEP  LEARNING  MACHINES THAT PERCEIVE THE WORLD  Deep learning  is the fastest-growing and most advanced field in machine learning.  It uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to find patterns in unstructured data such as  images, sound, video and text.  Deep learning has achieved record breaking performance on widely used datasets  such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. In many competitions, the only algorithm deep learning  competes against is itself.  4  Deep Learning for EnterpriseUSE CASES  Deep learning  is used to solve the hardest problems i n machine intelligence.

All Skymind products, such as DL4J, ND4J,  DavaVec, JavaCPP and Arbiter are 100% open-source and maintained by the most   active deep learning community in existence.  is   Deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j  the  first  commercial-grade,  open-source,  distributed  deep-learning  library  written  for  Java  and  Scala.  Integrated with Hadoop and Spark, DL4J is specifically designed to  be used in business environments on distributed GPUs and CPUs.  ND4J: Numpy for the JVM ND4J is a scientific computing library for the JVM. It‚Äôs Numpy for  Java and Scala. It is built for efficiency in production environments,  not as a research tool, so routines are designed to run fast with  minimum RAM requirements.  DataVec DataVec is an Apache 2.0 licensed open-source tool for machine  learning ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The goal of  DataVec is to transform and preprocess raw data into usable  vector formats across machine learning tools.  Arbiter A tool dedicated to evaluating and tuning machine learning  models. Part of the DL4J Suite of Machine Learning / Deep  Learning tools for the enterprise.   8  Deep Learning for EnterpriseFIRST COMMERCIAL-GRADE,  OPEN-SOURCE, DISTRIBUTED   DEEP LEARNING LIBRARY  Deeplearning4j is the most widely used open-source deep learning tool   for the JVM. Its aim is to bring deep learning to the production stack,  integrating tightly with popular big data frameworks like Hadoop and   Spark.  Skymind‚Äôs suite of tools takes advantage of the latest distributed computing  frameworks including Hadoop and Apache Spark to improve model training.  Deep learning excels at identifying patterns in unstructured data.   This includes images, sound, time series and text.  SOUND  TEXT  TIME SERIES  IMAGE  VIDEO  9   We‚Äôre  often  asked  why  we  chose  to  implement  an  open-source  deep  learning  project  in  Java,  when so much of the deep-learning community  is focused on Python. And the answers are speed   and security for enterprise deployment.  WRITE ONCE, RUN EVERYWHERE  Java‚Äôs  popularity  is  only  strengthened  by  its  ecosystem.  Most  enterprises  use  Java  or  a  JVM- based big data system.

Using  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  called  an autoencoder, Orange Silicon Valley analyzes call detail  records (CDRs) to find patterns that identify fraud. The ANN  also predicts the likelihood that an instance is fraudulent.  Where a static rule system flags cases only as likely fraud  or not, the ANN enables Orange‚Äôs analysts to prioritize  high probability cases of SIM Box fraud.  ‚ÄúThe problem is that fraud moves so quickly that it has  been difficult for Orange‚Äôs static algorithms to detect  it,‚Äù told by Georges Nahon, CEO of Orange Silicon Valley  19   SKYMIND INC.
