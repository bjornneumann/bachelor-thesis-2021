‚Äú   is the (cid:31)rst online  platform for obituaries, memorials   and condolences  ‚Äù  Announcing the death of a close family member is  physically difficult, emotionally painful and socially  awkward.  The process is inconvenient for both the family  and their network of friends.  PROBLEM  Family  Friends  It‚Äôs culturally very important for  families to honour their loved  ones and instantly get the news  out,  families either have to post in  newspapers or they rely on infor- mal tools.  Newspaper annunce- ments are extremely expensive,  inconvenient, and no longer have  the expected wide reach.  While  social media and other informal  tools lack value and don‚Äôt neces- sarily reach the right people.  Friends have to get informed on  time and attend the funeral. They  do not have the right tools to send  condolences and support the  family during their hardship. They  can post in the newspapers, send  telegrams or use informal tools.  Newspaper condolences are  extremely expensive and do not  reach everyone. Telegrams are  inconvenient and informal tools  are irrelevant.   - We decided to start with the Middle East as an entry point and then scale globally. It‚Äôs a very under utilised  region with untapped opportunities.   - Arabs publish obituaries and condolences in hard copy newspapers because it‚Äôs the only available platform.  - Our market is composed of those who post obituaries (creators) and people who want to know who passed  away to send condolences (subscribers)  - Taking Egypt as an example, 0.5m people die every year. Because newspapers are costly and don‚Äôt have a wide  reach ( less than 4% penetration), only 4.7k obituaries are posted annually (1% of deaths). The average price of  the post is as high as $1.5k. Our model allows us to acquire a bigger share of  the already big market due to  a(cid:30)ordably and convenience by targeting a wider social classes.  - As for subscribers we are targeting the wider Arabic speaking population who want to stay up to date and  send condolences. This market is as big as 300m out of which more than 45% are internet users and could be  potential customers.  - The market is similar not only in other Arab countries but in African and Central Asian, so the model could be  replicated and tailored for such markets  The services we o(cid:30)er are divided  into three main pillars  Announcing the death  and honoring the person:   -  Online obituaries  - Email obituaries  - App announcements - SMS shots   By integrating our service with  social networks we easily map out  people‚Äôs social connections to  automatically notify them when a  match is made.  Sending Condolences:   Process Facilitation:  People can pay their respects  through innovative:  - Online condolences  - Personalised letters, flowers, and  packages - Online initiatives to raise money  for a charitable cause in the name  of the deceased.
