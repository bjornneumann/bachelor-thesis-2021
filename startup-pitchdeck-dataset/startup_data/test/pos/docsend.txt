Why do some startups get  funded? What makes for the  best pitch? How does the  process work?  DocSend recently teamed up with Professor  Tom Eisenmann from Harvard Business School.  Together, we conducted research that gave  us the answers to those questions. We studied  the fundraising of 200 startup companies as  they went through their Series Seed and Series  A rounds. Altogether, these companies raised  more than $360 million.  $  200 COMPANIES  $360M RAISED  from    What We Learned 200 Startups  $360MWho Raised  DocSend is a sales enablement tool  that tracks per-page analytics on  document usage and is a popular  way for founders to send pitch decks  to investors. This put us in a unique  position to conduct this study.  All of the companies that we chose  through our selection process opted  into the research. In addition to  sending their decks to investors using  DocSend, they answered a detailed  questionnaire on what the overall  fundraising process was like. Some  of the companies that participated  include August Locks, Panjo, Shift  Cars, Back to the Roots, Wiser, Tiggly,  20twenty, Boomtrain, and mNectar.  2  Stats From an Average Series Seed Raise  Starting a company is a brutal process. Getting outside funding is a necessary step for many tech  startups, but it‚Äôs an opaque and frustrating process for those doing it for the first time. With that in mind,  we wanted to shed some light on what a typical successful seed round looks like.  Here are some of our main findings:  Fundraising Process  Deck  M 3  .  1 $  0  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  58Investors  Contacted   40Investor  Meetings  $1.3MCapital  Raised  12.5Weeks  to Close  19.2Page Avg  Deck Length  03:44  Minute Avg Visit Time  3  Seven Actionable Takeaways  If you‚Äôre thinking of raising a seed round for your  startup, here are seven take aways from hundreds  of companies who successfully raised.  Keep your deck to 20 pages or  fewer. Each visit will only be 3m  44sec on average.  20-30  Raising seed funding will take  longer than you think. Don‚Äôt start  to despair until you‚Äôve been at it  for a few months.  Try to raise from a seed firm  before you go to angels.

Focus on getting  quality introductions to investors  who are likely to be a fit. Quality  over quantity.  You‚Äôll likely need to contact 20-30  investors. But you won‚Äôt need to  contact hundreds.  Spend time on your deck.  Specifically, make sure your  team slide looks awesome. If you  include a financial slide, which is  optional, remember it‚Äôll be your  most viewed.  Don‚Äôt list your deal terms in your  deck. Deliver them in person.  The terms can vary by investor.  4  5  6  7  Table of Contents  The optimal pitch deck  What to expect and how to manage the  fundraising process  Series A, the next step  Slides   6-10  11-15  16-17  5  Designing a Successful Seed Deck  The average length of the seed decks we studied was roughly 19 pages, and most had a similar format.  The following table shows the types of pages used in the average order by the frequency in which  they occurred. This table also notes the average length for each section of the deck, if that figure was  included. We categorized pages according to Sequoia Capital‚Äôs list of recommended categories.  Company Purpose  1.8  73% Product  5  96%  Problem  Solution  Why Now  2  88% Team  1.2  100%  1.2  69% Business Model  3.4  81%  1.7  46% Competition  1.4  65%  Market Size  1.4  73% Financials  2.3  58%  Smart Key Category If included, # of pages  % decks including  6  Recommended Deck Ordering  The ordering for DocSend and Sequoia differed only in a few places:  1  Company Purpose  6  Product  1  Company Purpose  6  OBSERVED ORDER  SEQUOIA  RECOMMENDED ORDER  2  3  4  5  Problem  Solution  Why Now  Market Size  7  Team  2  8  Business Model  9  10  Competition  Financials  3  4  5  Problem  Solution  Why Now  Market Size  Competition  Product  7  8  Business Model  9  Team  10  Financials  The ordering of the sections was fairly standard, except for the team page. This page appeared either  at the beginning or the end, but never in the middle. Within the 200 companies we studied, more  companies placed the page at the end and not the beginning. This practice is in line with advice from  Reid Hoffman, who advises companies to lead with their investment thesis, not a team page.  7  The Average Pitch Deck View  Viewers studied the average successful  deck for 3 minutes, 44 seconds. This time  might not sound like much, but the length  was more than we expected. Compare that  time to DocSend‚Äôs own pitch deck, viewed  on average for a little more than two  minutes. Twelve percent of investors read  the pitch decks from their mobile phones  as well, so make sure your deck looks OK  on a tiny screen.  Mobile Views  100%  12%  investors  of  0  8  Which Pages Matter the Most  A few questions arise: Where was this view time spent within the pitch? If you spend extra time fixing up  your deck, which pages should you focus on? Where should you anticipate questions? The following  table shows the average time spent per page in each category.  Categories Financials Team Competition Why Now Company Purpose Business Model Product Market Size Problem Solution  Time / Page View in Seconds 23.2 22.8 16.6 16.3 15.3 14.9 13.9 13.3 11.3 10.6  0  5s  10s  15s  20s  25s  Interestingly, although the financial category takes the place, only 57 percent of successful decks  have this section. The low rate of inclusion is mostly due to the fact that many seed stage firms do not  yet have financial results on projections. Almost all of the seed decks, and many of the A decks, don‚Äôt  contain any significant financials to discuss. If you include financials, be very thoughtful with the content, as viewers will spend the most time on this  section. Ensure your team slide, whether at the end or the beginning, also looks amazing. One thing that‚Äôs important to note is that almost no decks listed the amount they were raising and the  terms of their fundraise. This information is always better delivered in person, and can vary from investor  to investor.  9  Example Pitch Decks  Some of the companies in our data set agreed to share their decks publicly.

Within DocSend‚Äôs data set, on average, the round  took 12 1/2 weeks. However, we saw much variation around this average. One-fifth of the companies  took 20 weeks or longer, and another one-fifth took six weeks or fewer. The longest successful round  took 40 weeks to close.  Companies that failed to successfully raise funds gave up after an average of 6.7 weeks. These  companies may have failed simply for lack of patience: the companies that had successful rounds  reported that the process took longer than expected. We asked the research participants to rate the  actual length of their fundraising round against their expectations. On a scale of one to five, where three  was ‚Äúas expected‚Äù and five was ‚Äúwaaaaay longer,‚Äù the average response for seed rounds was 3.6.  Seed Round in Weeks  0 - 515%  6 - 1026%  11 - 1542%  16 and up17%  Certainly, while patience is beneficial for startups, knowing when to give up, take a step back, and  take a fresh look at the situation is important. Three-fourths of the companies that failed to raise  seed funding planned to try again, and the average time until they plan to restart their efforts is 8.9  weeks‚Äîplenty of time to make progress on their business and incorporate feedback.  11  Strive for Quality, Not Quantity, of Investors It‚Äôs tempting to think that the more investors  you contact, the better your chances of raising  money. Unfortunately, this situation isn‚Äôt the  case. Certainly, the more investors you contact,  the more meetings you‚Äôll get, up to a point.  Note: in the data reported here, an entrepreneur  could have multiple meetings with one investor,  making it possible to have more meetings than  investors contacted.  Contacting more investors will get you more  meetings, but it won‚Äôt necessarily get you more  money. Focus on the quality of your connection  to the investors you contact. In this graph, we  compare the number of investors contacted  and the amount of funding raised. There  isn‚Äôt much correlation, and if anything, the  impression is a bit negative.  Investors contacted vs meetings  Contacted vs money  s g n  i t  e e m    r o t s e v n I  200  150  100  50  0  0  200  100 Investors contacted  300  d e r e  f f  o    y e n o M  6M  4.5M  3M  1.5M  0  0  100  200  300  Investors contacted  Contacting more investors will get you   more meetings, up to a point.  Contacting more investors won't help   raise more money.  12  What to Do and When to Give Up  Create a list of 30 investors you feel would be particularly passionate about your pitch. Most of the  startups in our data set had to contact only 20 to 30 investors to close their round. If none of them agree to invest, something may be off about what or how you‚Äôre pitching. Take their  feedback seriously and make some changes to your pitch before contacting more investors. If you still  haven‚Äôt closed investors after contacting 100 of them, you should seriously rethink either your timing in  the market or the project. A few companies raise money after contacting more than 100 investors, but  that scenario is rare and a big drain on your time.  How Much and From Whom to Raise  Earlier, we noted the average seed round in DocSend‚Äôs data set was $1.3 million. The amount and  the process, however, varied widely depending on whether the entrepreneur raised from angels or  a seed firm. Angel investors are wealthy individuals who give their own money to a project; they typically give  between $25,000 and $100,000. Seed firms are small venture capital funds that pursue investments  on a full-time basis. These firms usually invest between $250,000 and $1 million in a project.  $25,000  $100,000  Angels  Seed firms  0  13  $250,000  $1,000,000  Angels vs Seed Firms  The following are a few of the key trade-offs:  Angels  Seed Firms  Angels are typically operators,  so they can relate and have a  personal interest in your  project. Because you'll have a  few angels in your round, you'll  have a sizable support group  behind you.  Angels have busy lives and  fluctuating funds, so you may  not always be able to rely on  them for the money and  support you need. You also  need to sell to more of them for  a round.  Pros  Cons  These firms have professional,  savvy investors. The firms  invest more, so they have a  greater financial interest in  seeing you succeed. Firms also  have more money to give you  later if you need it.  Firms may try to control your  business decisions, and they  aren't always qualified to give  you the best advice. Firms also  see a lot of deals, so it's hard to  get their attention.  14  Firm Rounds: Rarer but Better  In general, angel-led seed rounds are much more common than firm-led seed rounds. According to  David S. Rose, an angel investor, seed firms fund about 1,500 startups each year while angels fund  roughly 50,000. This discrepancy is partially because seed firms invest in about one of every 400  companies they consider, while angels choose one out of every 40. Those numbers are by no means  exact, but they do illustrate that if you wish to get a firm‚Äôs attention, you need to have an outstanding  pitch deck and know the selling points of your business inside and out. According to DocSend‚Äôs data, although angel-led seed rounds are more common, firm-led rounds have  much more favorable characteristics. If you are able to raise funds from a firm, you‚Äôll get twice as much  money in 30 percent less time. You‚Äôll also need to contact only 40 percent as many investors.   The following summarizes the differences:  Avg time to fundraise (weeks) Avg investors contacted Avg investor meetings  $per contact  Firm Angel  0  Firm 9.6 29 27  Angel 13.5 68 45  $17,210  Firm  Angel  Avg money raised  $1,995,952  $989,118  % oversubscribed  36.8%  18.9%  $91,830  $100k  Our recommendation is to try raising from a Seed Fund first.  15  Series A vs Series Seed Rounds  Series A rounds are much less common than seed rounds. In DocSend‚Äôs data set, nine seed rounds  existed for every series A round. It appears that the Series A Crunch is still in effect. Although we have  fewer data points, we managed to collect some statistics on the differences between seed and A rounds.  If you are able to raise a Series A round, the process is easier than for a seed round. A rounds take less  time, yield more money, and require fewer investors than seed rounds.  Here are some of the key facts we gathered:  26investors  During A rounds,   companies contacted   an average of 26  investors, versus 58  investors contacted  for seed rounds.  9.6weeks  Series A rounds  took an average  of 9.6 weeks, 24  percent less time  than the time given   for the average  seed round.  16  30  investor meetings During A rounds,  companies had on  average 30 investor  meetings, versus 40  investor meetings for   seed rounds.  $1.3million  The average money  raised during seed  rounds was just  under $1.3 million,  where the money  raised during A  rounds was more  than $8 million.  Easiest Markets for Seed Funding   The following are some of the key statistics on the fundraising  efforts of the four types of business models:  Consumer  Business  Marketplace  Hardware  % deals  32%  M 2 $  32%  22%  avg $ raised  14%  $945,870  $1,245,435  $1,738,750  $1,330,000  Consumers‚Äô needs and other  economic conditions impact which  business models receive the  greatest success during fundraising.  While trends are always fluctuating,  in the past 12 months, four types of  companies stood out as having the  most success during seed rounds:  consumer, business, marketplace,  and hardware. On average, marketplace  companies raised the most money  in their seed rounds. Successful  marketplace businesses are quite  rare, but when they work, they‚Äôre  also much bigger, like Uber or  Airbnb. Raising money for a  marketplace startup takes a long  time. Although there‚Äôs a lot of money  for companies in these categories,  convincing investors that your  startup is going to win takes longer.  17  To Recap, Seven Key Takeaways  Fundraising for your startup can be an opaque and  frustrating process when the future of your business  is on the line.
