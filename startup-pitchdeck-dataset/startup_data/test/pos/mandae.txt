Also note that this calculation  is on a per item basis: with our routing system, several items may  be picked up at each stop, and each trip may include several  stops. As we optimize the number of stops and items per route,  pickup costs per item decrease  substantially.  Historical growth proxy of our customer segments  Brazil e-commerce  Mercado Livre  Number of e-Commerces (thousands)  Revenues (US$mm)   23  20  17  12  14  374  299  217  137  173  400  300  200  100  0  08  09  10  11  12  08  09  10  11  12  Correios  Revenues (US$bn)  5.31  5.85  4.69  6.36  6.70  Items sold (mm)   67.4  52.8  39.2  29.5  21.1  80  60  40  20  0  08  09  10  11  12  08  09  10  11  12  25  20  15  10  5  0  8  6  4  2  0  Growth in target markets and projected   Manda√™ customer base  Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  BRL targeted market (R$ bn)  9.1  10.0  10.9  11.7  12.6  No. of households  54,000,000  54,810,000  55,577,000  56,299,000  56,975,000  No. of internet sellers  3,000,000  3,450,000  3,915,000  4,385,000  4,846,000  No. of e-commerce stores  29,000  36,250  45,000  56,500  71,000  Total  Individual users  % market share  Internet sellers  % market share  E-commerce stores  % market share  Total  57,029,000  58,296,250  59,537,000  60,740,500  61,892,000  82,000  1,125,000  2,200,000  3,300,000  4,300,000  0.2%  2,900  0.1%  250  0.9%  2.1%  4.0%  5,.9%  7.5%  45,000  150,000  330,000  600,000  1.3%  3,500  9.7%  3.8%  6,250  7.5%  9,500  13.9%  16.8%  12.4%  13,000  18.3%  85,150  1,173,500  2,356,250  3,639,500  4,913,000  s t e k r a m    t e g r a T  e s a b   r e m o t s u c     √™ a d n a M  Note: Projected revenues (shown earlier in this presentation) were calculated based off of these customer base projections using the same assumptions  that were used to calculate the LTV‚Äôs of our customer segments (weighted average shipping revenue of R$26 / item, utilization % and annual shipments)    Target market growth rates were estimated using census projections/Correios‚Äô growth rates, projected growth rates of marketplaces such as  MercadoLivre, and projections for Brazilian e-commerce growth  By making shipping easy, our vision is to   help more people ship even more stuff  Projected Manda√™ gross revenues  (R$ millions)  This creates value for everybody...  800  700  600  500  400  300  200  100  0  E-commerce  Online sellers  Individuals  R$ 698  ÔÉ®More people and e-commerce stores  can sell more stuff online, benefitting  the broader economy  R$ 389  ÔÉ®More shipment volume for Correios   and other carriers, thereby increasing  the size of the entire shipments ‚Äúpie‚Äù   R$163  ...which in turn accrues to Manda√™  R$53  $3  ÔÉ®Compelling solution creates a case for   high adoption, usage and revenues  Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Note: See appendix for further details regarding market, customer base, and revenue forecasts  Customer lifetime value calculations  General assumptions  Revenue per shipment R$26 Contribution margin  40%  Per segment LTV calculations  Inflation / price increases Discount rate  6% 15%  Note:  See page on Market for details on Segmented Addressable Market for each customer segment. The assumptions used above fall within general macro statistics or have been reasonably adjusted for customer type. E.g., average shipments by internet sellers is 7/year;  we adjusted to 24 to account for greater power seller concentration. Average shipments per e-commerce store is 2,319; we used a  significantly more conservative estimate of 120. We also used a more conservative average shipment cost estimate; average industry  shipment spend per package is between R$30-R$50.  First-year monthly forecast  Five-year projections  Key modeling assumptions  ÔÇß General pricing assumptions assume average shipping revenue / item of R$ 20 (with 6% annual   inflation increases), plus a R$10  pickup fee for 1-item orders  ÔÇß Customer segment assumptions:  -  Individuals: 3 shipments / year, 75% utilization of Manda√™, 33% annual attrition rate, 1.1 items  per pickup, R$ 32 in revenues per pickup. CPA of between R$ 2 and R$ 5.  - Online sellers: 24 shipments / year, 90% utilization of Manda√™, 33% annual attrition rate, 1.8   items per pickup, 1.1 visits per month, R$ 40 in revenues per pickup. CPA of R$ 5.  - E-commerce: 120 shipments / year, 90% utilization of Manda√™, 50% annual attrition rate, 2.9   items per pickup, 3.5 visits per month, R$ 58 in revenues per pickup. CPA of R$ 5.  ÔÇß Shipping costs conservatively calculated using standard contract pricing tables published by the   Correios (Brazil‚Äôs postal service)  - Costs are based on published contract tables, not hypothetical volume discounts  - Costs decrease quickly with incremental volume increases  - Our aggregate shipping costs will vary depending on the shipment destinations. We used   conservative assumptions, meaning we assumed unfavorable routes and discounts. We  anticipate that in reality, we‚Äôll be able to realize higher cost-savings than what‚Äôs assumed in our  financial plan.  Thank you!
