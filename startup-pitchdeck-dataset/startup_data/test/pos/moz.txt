Rand starts working  w/ Gillian building  websites for small,   local businesses  Deeply in debt, and failing   to get traffic to clients‚Äô  sites, Rand starts the  SEOmoz Blog as part of  learning the SEO process.  SEOmoz takes an   investment of $1.1M  from Ignition Partners   & Curious Office  Moz‚Äôs collection of tools   becomes a singular,   campaign-based web app.  Prices rise to $99 / $499 /   $1999 per month.  1997  2004  Nov. 2007  Sept. 2010  1981  2001  Feb. 2007  Oct. 2008  July 2011  Gillian (Rand‚Äôs   Mom) founds the  company that will  become SEOmoz  Rand drops out of  UW, 2 classes from  graduation to work  full time w/ Gillian  SEOmoz launches its   first subscription  software product,   ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù for $39/month  Linkscape, SEOmoz‚Äôs web   SEOmoz is moving from   index and link graph,   just ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù to social media,   launches.

At one point, Rand + Gillian had just under $500K in personal debt.  By 2007, it was all paid off, thanks to the magical super-awesomeness of SEO!  2011 will be our first 8   figure year, and we   maintain margins of 83%+  Monthly  Visits  We took one round of   financing in 2007; $1.1MM  from Ignition + Curious Office  April of 2011, we   hit 1.2+MM   visits/month and  10K+ subscribers  In 2009, we dropped  consulting entirely  More about our history   How‚Äôd We Do That?  News/Media/PR  SEO  Email  Blogs + Blogging  Research/White Papers  Comment Marketing  Online Video  Forums  INBOUND MARKETING! (AKA all the ‚Äúfree‚Äù traffic sources)  Infographics  Social Networks  Local Portals  Webinars  Social Bookmarking  Word of Mouth  Direct/Referring Links  Podcasting  Type-In Traffic  Q+A Sites  Up until 2010, SEOmoz had never spent money directly to acquire customers! (No PPC, no ads,  just conferences and content production, aka ‚Äúsweat marketing‚Äù) ÔÅä  That‚Äôs what we want to help other  companies measure + improve through our   cloud-based software.  Macroeconomic Trends that   Benefit Moz  Marketing Spend is Still Unbalanced vs. Behavior  Via   Organic Marketing is Under-Invested  Organic drives  90%+ of traffic (but garners only   ~$5 billion of   investment in 2011)  Paid drives  <10% of web   traffic  (but wins a whopping   $31+ Billion of   investment in 2011)  Percent of Web Traffic from Various Sources to the Average Website  Web Traffic is driven  almost entirely by organic/earned media, yet nearly all of the investment in driving  traffic to websites is through paid channels‚Ä¶ This is an unsustainable dichotomy.  It‚Äôs a Data-Driven World and Efficiency is King  These challenges require scalable, high quality software to solve. Very few companies are investing in  this space in a serious way, and almost none target the SMB market.  Problem(s) We‚Äôre Here to Solve  Organic Web Marketing is Poorly Understood  Invest in Content, Search,   Social, Local and/or   Participatory Online Channels  Measure Traffic and   ROI Effectively  Re-Invest in ROI- Positive Channels  Earn Outsized   Traffic/Branding/Customer  Acquisition Rewards vs. Paid   Marketing Channels  Even those marketers who have an understanding of the process often get lost in the details or mired  in the complexity of tying creative to metrics.  The Web Marketer‚Äôs Weekly Analytics Challenge  Every week (sometimes daily), web marketers need to log in to  each of these services (or a suitable substitute) to collect their KPIs:  Many (75%+):  Most (~50%):  Some (~10%):  Google Analytics  Bing Webmaster Tools  Facebook Insights  Google Alerts  Twitter (Topsy/Hootsuite)  Feedburner  Google Webmaster Tools    SEOmoz  PostRank  FourSquare  Google Local  Yahoo! Site Explorer  Yelp  Why should a marketer log into 10+ sites/tools just to get the basic numbers they need to measure  and improve their campaigns? Moz can (and should) put this all in one place.  Specific, Painful Web Marketing Tasks  Each of these requires special tools, large amounts of manual labor  or custom-built, in-house/agency solutions:  Researching New   Opportunities  Identifying High-  ROI Channels  Prioritizing +  Managing Tasks  Finding Errors +   Problems  Optimizing   Existing Channels  Training New   Marketers   These challenges require scalable, high quality software to solve. Very few companies are investing in  this space in a serious way, and almost none target the SMB market.  Our Target Market  Moz has captured an   estimated 5-10% of just  these 2 circles to date  Today, Moz focuses on just the red ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù circles. In the future, many more of these will become  customer targets.
