We are winning for four reasons:   1  2  3  4  Our product is superior  (screenshot) and implicitly viral.  They are abandoning CapMx  for Shareworks which is not  ready for private companies  The customer service is  horrible. Their customers hate  them.  CapMX pricing is ridiculous. It  costs $3K for a company to  access its own cap table.  Perkins Coie chose eShares after an in-depth evaluation  We will start onboarding 500 Perkins Coie companies in October.   We are lean and mean  And got a lot done in a short time and not much money  In one year and $1.2M, we built‚Ä¶.

Nodes are funds and companies.  What is a Transfer Agent (TA)?  ‚ÄúTransfer agents record changes of ownership, maintain the issuer's security holder   records, cancel and issue certiÔ¨Åcates, and distribute dividends. Because transfer  agents stand between issuing companies and security holders, eÔ¨Écient transfer  agent operations are critical to the successful completion of secondary trades.‚Äù  Risk Factors  This is what can derail our plan.  1  2  Transaction revenue does not continue as forecasted We are unable to drive volume through option exercises  There is a systemic market downturn in tech Our customers are highly sensitive to the current tech bull market  3 We are unable to win the major law Ô¨Årms  They choose to stay with Solium and migrate to Shareworks  4 We have a security breach  And lose conÔ¨Ådence of our customers and the market as a whole  The top 3 TAs combined market cap is $15B  It is a large and overlooked market.  $2 billion   (est)  $7.2 billion  $5.1 billion  This is the food chain we need to climb  There are other competitors but these are the ones that matter.

Value the company once and sells ‚Äúviews‚Äù into the data.  Offer the same valuation service at 80% discount and   earn more revenue than any Ô¨Årm today.  $100 per fund  SFAS157 fair market value   Preferred price  $500  409A fair market value   Common price  Corporation  $500 + $100 x 20 =    $2,500  Fund #1   Fund #2  Fund #20
