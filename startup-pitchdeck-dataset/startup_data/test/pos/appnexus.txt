AppNexus  Infrastructure for a Connected World  Contents  ‚Ä¢ Founders ‚Ä¢ Why AppNexus? ‚Ä¢ Differentiation / Competitive Analysis ‚Ä¢ Timeline ‚Ä¢ Financials  Founders  ‚Ä¢ Brian O‚ÄôKelley, CEO - former CTO of Right Media.  Invented, built, sold, and launched the Right Media  Exchange. Scaled the RM environment from 10 to  1500 servers and felt the pain of not having  AppNexus.  ‚Ä¢ Michiel Nolet, VP of Product - former Director of   Analytics at Right Media.  Why AppNexus  1B imps/day of volume... next week  Right Media challenges ‚Ä¢ Scale - MySpace is going to send an extra  ‚Ä¢ Globalization - Yahoo! Japan wants to do a  ‚Ä¢ Integration - let‚Äôs integrate a contextual  analysis platform... to all 6 datacenters...  pilot, but only if servers are in Japan...  Solving the Problems  ‚Ä¢ Scale: Cloud computing would have been  great - flip servers on when we need them ‚Ä¢ Global: Multiple clouds, with smart routing /  ‚Ä¢ Integration: Run new services ‚Äúin-cloud‚Äù  load balancing, in key geographies   Nexus ‚Ä¢ The cloud becomes a ‚Äúnexus‚Äù where  ‚Ä¢ Cloud layer needs to be robust, reliable,  ‚Ä¢ Centralized directory, documentation,   applications can consume services  easy-to-use, etc to get adoption  Cloud   ‚Üí  community, and billing for service providers  Cloud Architecture  Nexuses  moving global quickly   ‚Ä¢ One Nexus isn‚Äôt enough - applications are  ‚Ä¢ Multiple Nexuses around the world, each  ‚Ä¢ Build tools to help scale applications (data   with same services and applications  tier especially)  $10/core/day (virtualized, of course)  Revenue Sources ‚Ä¢ Rent high-end 4-core boxes for around  ‚Ä¢ Rent database boxes, storage, bandwidth,  backup, and many other things too ‚Ä¢ Profit-sharing with service providers ‚Ä¢ Access fees  Competitive Analysis  there - will be compelling)  Differentiators - Near Term ‚Ä¢ Global (some tough problems to solve  ‚Ä¢ Ops tools (very challenging to build a  ‚Ä¢ Customer-centric (not exciting, but need to  get the little things right - it‚Äôs a small world,  and trust travels)  scalable ops layer)  Differentiators - Long Term ‚Ä¢ With network effect (lots of services & lots   of applications) will be difficult for a new  cloud player to compete - will need to  recruit the services to get the apps and will  need to recruit the apps to get the services  ‚Ä¢ Lots of tools - idea is to get applications   ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to the AppNexus way  Competition  ‚Ä¢ Amazon / EC2 (biggest risk - they have  capital, the SOA concept, and momentum) ‚Ä¢ Rackspace / Gridlayer (hosting companies  have the hardware and the customer base,  but probably not the SOA mentality)  ‚Ä¢ Google / Yahoo / MSFT etc (not in space   now, but have the capex to enter)  Growth Plan  ‚ÄúPing pong‚Äù growth ‚Ä¢ First applications sign up for the cloud ‚Ä¢ These clients become leverage to recruit  ‚Ä¢ Co-market with software providers to get  ‚Ä¢ Repeat...  more applications on board  software providers  Phase 1: The Cloud  ‚Ä¢ Build-out and deploy robust physical and   virtual infrastructure to underlie the  Nexuses  ‚Ä¢ Can be profitable as a standalone service  Phase 1 Logistics  ‚Ä¢ First location live Jan 2008; 2nd in Mar-Apr ‚Ä¢ Work closely with initial clients to refine ops layers  (monitoring, provisioning, cluster management tools)  ‚Ä¢ Beta launch Jan 2008, Scale to 20 clients by mid-2008 ‚Ä¢ Ideal clients are platforms and services (natural SOA   consumers and purchasers)  ‚Ä¢ Fund via $2-3MM seed round (plus $2MM of personally   guaranteed debt)  Phase 1 Pipeline  ‚Ä¢ Behavioral Marketing (Exelate, Blue Kai,  Media Six Degrees) ‚Ä¢ SaaS (Wide Orbit) ‚Ä¢ Gaming (Garage Games) ‚Ä¢ Video CDN (Digital Fountain)  Phase 2: Credibility ‚Ä¢ Go elephant hunting - recruit the   platforms that will make all the services  want to be in their Nexus (or vice versa) ‚Ä¢ Aggressively brand as the high-end of the  cloud market - graduate from EC2  Competitor/Cloud-Computing provider  ‚Ä¢ Leverage key differentiators to keep   pricing high; continue to build IP  Phase 2 Logistics  ‚Ä¢ Start in Q3 2008 ‚Ä¢ Raise $10-15MM to ramp team, provide  ‚Ä¢ Need global presence - market may be   working capital for 2000+ servers  stronger (as is currency) overseas  Phase 3: Nexus  effect begins to build  ‚Ä¢ With key clients and critical mass, network  ‚Ä¢ Focus on comarketing with partners - help  service providers recruit platforms & apps ‚Ä¢ Provide arms to both sides of a war that   never ends...  Phase 3 Logistics  ‚Ä¢ Begin in early 2010 ‚Ä¢ Infrastructure side of business should be   self-sustaining at this point, so shift to  marketing, support, evangelism  ‚Ä¢ Be opportunistic about acquiring facilities ‚Ä¢ Business should be profitable but raise $25-  50MM to expand (and compete)  Financials
