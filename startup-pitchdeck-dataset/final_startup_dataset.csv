adpushup,"Ad Revenue Optimization  for Web Publishers   Problem  Display Advertising CTRs (click through rates) have been falling[1] constantly and one of the primary reason behind it is banner blindness.  Current Players such as Ad Networks/Exchanges/SSPs help publishers  improve the CTR/RPM primarily by making the ads more relevant  (through user bucketing/targeting), improving the fill rates and finding  the highest bidder for each impression (RTB).  But they have no direct control over the last mile of the road, which is  the placement of ads on the publisher‚Äôs website.  [1] DoubleClick for Advertisers, a cross section of regions, January and December 2009, Published July 2010  Solution  Publishers can optimize their ad revenues by testing different ad  placements, ad sizes and ad types, which improves the CTR (Click  through rate) and RPM (Revenue per Thousand Impressions) for them.  Further, using constant optimization, they can easily fight the big evil  called Banner Blindness.  Why Now?  AdTech is growing. Display Advertising (display, mobile and video) is  forecasted to grow from approximately $43 billion in 2012 to $90 billion  in 2017[1].  AdTech investments have been able to do IPOs recently (Rubicon, Rocketfuel, Marin). Outbrain, RadiumOne and more to file soon.  A/B Testing is a hot market (Optimizely, VWO) and no one is using it for  Publishers, yet.  [1] Rubicon S-1 Filing ()  Product  AdPushup uses advanced A/B Testing (a proprietary multi-arm bandit  solution) to web publishers optimize ad revenues by using advanced a/b  testing between different ad placements, ad sizes, ad colors and types  (such as image vs text).  All this simply by using a simple visual editor and no programming  knowledge.  After finding the best variation, It keeps a check on banner blindness to  keep your placements optimized at all times and can help fight AdBlock.  Case Study  RPM (Revenue per thousand impressions) Optimized from $3.82 to $12.1  Milestones  May 2013 ‚Äì Starts as weekend project.  Aug 2013 ‚Äì PoC Testing using JS Hacks.  Jan 2014 ‚Äì Founders commit full-time.  March 2014 ‚Äì First private beta release. Enrollment begins.

We can monetize by: 1) SaaS plans (fixed prices based on impressions) for Large Publishers.  2) Serving additional ad units (display/native) for the medium and long  tail.  3) Helping publisher monetize the inventory being lost to Ad Blockers  Founders  Ankit Oberoi ‚Ä¢  Co-founded Innobuzz (2007) ‚Äì InfoSec Training & Products, MNC ‚Äì Empanelled with CERT-IN, DSCI & NASSCOM.

Its unique features are   -Anonymity: It allows communication without revealing your identity.   -Both web and mobile:  runs on both web and mobile  platforms.    Revenues are generated by selling extra features to users and  advertisements. Features include extra photo upload (US$0.5) and  promotion of profile (US$2.0). Users can promote their profiles in the  ‚Äúshuffle‚Äù section of main page.   PROBLEM   When you use WhatsApp or any other mobile messaging application, you can only  communicate with other mobile users. You cannot chat with people who are using a  computer.    Also, you either need to give your phone number or add them on Facebook just to get  messages when you are on mobile. There must be a way to chat while you are on mobile  without giving up your privacy.   SOLUTION   In  when you install the application you are given a link: .  Anyone going to that link can chat with you whether they are on mobile or on desktop.     On mobile they are redirected to our application, and on desktop they can directly chat from a  browser. You don't need to give your phone number, add them on Facebook, just give your  link. They don't even need to register, they are given anonymous nicknames and start to chat  with you immediately.      OUR STATISTICS   !   2.7 m+   Registered Users   8   200 k+  Daily Visitors   ""   100 k+   New Users / Month   United States ‚Äì 5%   Europe ‚Äì 19%   Turkey ‚Äì 50%   South America‚Äì 11%   OUR TEAM   REVENUE MODEL  FREEMIUM FEATURES   A  30%  extra photo  upload feature   b  30%    shuffle  promote  feature   i   a  30%    web   advertisement   revenue   O  10%    mobile in-app   purchases   ",0.615,neg,test

docsend,"Why do some startups get  funded? What makes for the  best pitch? How does the  process work?  DocSend recently teamed up with Professor  Tom Eisenmann from Harvard Business School.  Together, we conducted research that gave  us the answers to those questions. We studied  the fundraising of 200 startup companies as  they went through their Series Seed and Series  A rounds. Altogether, these companies raised  more than $360 million.  $  200 COMPANIES  $360M RAISED  from    What We Learned 200 Startups  $360MWho Raised  DocSend is a sales enablement tool  that tracks per-page analytics on  document usage and is a popular  way for founders to send pitch decks  to investors. This put us in a unique  position to conduct this study.  All of the companies that we chose  through our selection process opted  into the research. In addition to  sending their decks to investors using  DocSend, they answered a detailed  questionnaire on what the overall  fundraising process was like. Some  of the companies that participated  include August Locks, Panjo, Shift  Cars, Back to the Roots, Wiser, Tiggly,  20twenty, Boomtrain, and mNectar.  2  Stats From an Average Series Seed Raise  Starting a company is a brutal process. Getting outside funding is a necessary step for many tech  startups, but it‚Äôs an opaque and frustrating process for those doing it for the first time. With that in mind,  we wanted to shed some light on what a typical successful seed round looks like.  Here are some of our main findings:  Fundraising Process  Deck  M 3  .  1 $  0  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  $  58Investors  Contacted   40Investor  Meetings  $1.3MCapital  Raised  12.5Weeks  to Close  19.2Page Avg  Deck Length  03:44  Minute Avg Visit Time  3  Seven Actionable Takeaways  If you‚Äôre thinking of raising a seed round for your  startup, here are seven take aways from hundreds  of companies who successfully raised.  Keep your deck to 20 pages or  fewer. Each visit will only be 3m  44sec on average.  20-30  Raising seed funding will take  longer than you think. Don‚Äôt start  to despair until you‚Äôve been at it  for a few months.  Try to raise from a seed firm  before you go to angels. Firms  will give you more money in  less time with fewer meetings.   1  2  3  20  4  More meetings does not equal  more money. Focus on getting  quality introductions to investors  who are likely to be a fit. Quality  over quantity.  You‚Äôll likely need to contact 20-30  investors. But you won‚Äôt need to  contact hundreds.  Spend time on your deck.  Specifically, make sure your  team slide looks awesome. If you  include a financial slide, which is  optional, remember it‚Äôll be your  most viewed.  Don‚Äôt list your deal terms in your  deck. Deliver them in person.  The terms can vary by investor.  4  5  6  7  Table of Contents  The optimal pitch deck  What to expect and how to manage the  fundraising process  Series A, the next step  Slides   6-10  11-15  16-17  5  Designing a Successful Seed Deck  The average length of the seed decks we studied was roughly 19 pages, and most had a similar format.  The following table shows the types of pages used in the average order by the frequency in which  they occurred. This table also notes the average length for each section of the deck, if that figure was  included. We categorized pages according to Sequoia Capital‚Äôs list of recommended categories.  Company Purpose  1.8  73% Product  5  96%  Problem  Solution  Why Now  2  88% Team  1.2  100%  1.2  69% Business Model  3.4  81%  1.7  46% Competition  1.4  65%  Market Size  1.4  73% Financials  2.3  58%  Smart Key Category If included, # of pages  % decks including  6  Recommended Deck Ordering  The ordering for DocSend and Sequoia differed only in a few places:  1  Company Purpose  6  Product  1  Company Purpose  6  OBSERVED ORDER  SEQUOIA  RECOMMENDED ORDER  2  3  4  5  Problem  Solution  Why Now  Market Size  7  Team  2  8  Business Model  9  10  Competition  Financials  3  4  5  Problem  Solution  Why Now  Market Size  Competition  Product  7  8  Business Model  9  Team  10  Financials  The ordering of the sections was fairly standard, except for the team page. This page appeared either  at the beginning or the end, but never in the middle. Within the 200 companies we studied, more  companies placed the page at the end and not the beginning. This practice is in line with advice from  Reid Hoffman, who advises companies to lead with their investment thesis, not a team page.  7  The Average Pitch Deck View  Viewers studied the average successful  deck for 3 minutes, 44 seconds. This time  might not sound like much, but the length  was more than we expected. Compare that  time to DocSend‚Äôs own pitch deck, viewed  on average for a little more than two  minutes. Twelve percent of investors read  the pitch decks from their mobile phones  as well, so make sure your deck looks OK  on a tiny screen.  Mobile Views  100%  12%  investors  of  0  8  Which Pages Matter the Most  A few questions arise: Where was this view time spent within the pitch? If you spend extra time fixing up  your deck, which pages should you focus on? Where should you anticipate questions? The following  table shows the average time spent per page in each category.  Categories Financials Team Competition Why Now Company Purpose Business Model Product Market Size Problem Solution  Time / Page View in Seconds 23.2 22.8 16.6 16.3 15.3 14.9 13.9 13.3 11.3 10.6  0  5s  10s  15s  20s  25s  Interestingly, although the financial category takes the place, only 57 percent of successful decks  have this section. The low rate of inclusion is mostly due to the fact that many seed stage firms do not  yet have financial results on projections. Almost all of the seed decks, and many of the A decks, don‚Äôt  contain any significant financials to discuss. If you include financials, be very thoughtful with the content, as viewers will spend the most time on this  section. Ensure your team slide, whether at the end or the beginning, also looks amazing. One thing that‚Äôs important to note is that almost no decks listed the amount they were raising and the  terms of their fundraise. This information is always better delivered in person, and can vary from investor  to investor.  9  Example Pitch Decks  Some of the companies in our data set agreed to share their decks publicly.

Within DocSend‚Äôs data set, on average, the round  took 12 1/2 weeks. However, we saw much variation around this average. One-fifth of the companies  took 20 weeks or longer, and another one-fifth took six weeks or fewer. The longest successful round  took 40 weeks to close.  Companies that failed to successfully raise funds gave up after an average of 6.7 weeks. These  companies may have failed simply for lack of patience: the companies that had successful rounds  reported that the process took longer than expected. We asked the research participants to rate the  actual length of their fundraising round against their expectations. On a scale of one to five, where three  was ‚Äúas expected‚Äù and five was ‚Äúwaaaaay longer,‚Äù the average response for seed rounds was 3.6.  Seed Round in Weeks  0 - 515%  6 - 1026%  11 - 1542%  16 and up17%  Certainly, while patience is beneficial for startups, knowing when to give up, take a step back, and  take a fresh look at the situation is important. Three-fourths of the companies that failed to raise  seed funding planned to try again, and the average time until they plan to restart their efforts is 8.9  weeks‚Äîplenty of time to make progress on their business and incorporate feedback.  11  Strive for Quality, Not Quantity, of Investors It‚Äôs tempting to think that the more investors  you contact, the better your chances of raising  money. Unfortunately, this situation isn‚Äôt the  case. Certainly, the more investors you contact,  the more meetings you‚Äôll get, up to a point.  Note: in the data reported here, an entrepreneur  could have multiple meetings with one investor,  making it possible to have more meetings than  investors contacted.  Contacting more investors will get you more  meetings, but it won‚Äôt necessarily get you more  money. Focus on the quality of your connection  to the investors you contact. In this graph, we  compare the number of investors contacted  and the amount of funding raised. There  isn‚Äôt much correlation, and if anything, the  impression is a bit negative.  Investors contacted vs meetings  Contacted vs money  s g n  i t  e e m    r o t s e v n I  200  150  100  50  0  0  200  100 Investors contacted  300  d e r e  f f  o    y e n o M  6M  4.5M  3M  1.5M  0  0  100  200  300  Investors contacted  Contacting more investors will get you   more meetings, up to a point.  Contacting more investors won't help   raise more money.  12  What to Do and When to Give Up  Create a list of 30 investors you feel would be particularly passionate about your pitch. Most of the  startups in our data set had to contact only 20 to 30 investors to close their round. If none of them agree to invest, something may be off about what or how you‚Äôre pitching. Take their  feedback seriously and make some changes to your pitch before contacting more investors. If you still  haven‚Äôt closed investors after contacting 100 of them, you should seriously rethink either your timing in  the market or the project. A few companies raise money after contacting more than 100 investors, but  that scenario is rare and a big drain on your time.  How Much and From Whom to Raise  Earlier, we noted the average seed round in DocSend‚Äôs data set was $1.3 million. The amount and  the process, however, varied widely depending on whether the entrepreneur raised from angels or  a seed firm. Angel investors are wealthy individuals who give their own money to a project; they typically give  between $25,000 and $100,000. Seed firms are small venture capital funds that pursue investments  on a full-time basis. These firms usually invest between $250,000 and $1 million in a project.  $25,000  $100,000  Angels  Seed firms  0  13  $250,000  $1,000,000  Angels vs Seed Firms  The following are a few of the key trade-offs:  Angels  Seed Firms  Angels are typically operators,  so they can relate and have a  personal interest in your  project. Because you'll have a  few angels in your round, you'll  have a sizable support group  behind you.  Angels have busy lives and  fluctuating funds, so you may  not always be able to rely on  them for the money and  support you need. You also  need to sell to more of them for  a round.  Pros  Cons  These firms have professional,  savvy investors. The firms  invest more, so they have a  greater financial interest in  seeing you succeed. Firms also  have more money to give you  later if you need it.  Firms may try to control your  business decisions, and they  aren't always qualified to give  you the best advice. Firms also  see a lot of deals, so it's hard to  get their attention.  14  Firm Rounds: Rarer but Better  In general, angel-led seed rounds are much more common than firm-led seed rounds. According to  David S. Rose, an angel investor, seed firms fund about 1,500 startups each year while angels fund  roughly 50,000. This discrepancy is partially because seed firms invest in about one of every 400  companies they consider, while angels choose one out of every 40. Those numbers are by no means  exact, but they do illustrate that if you wish to get a firm‚Äôs attention, you need to have an outstanding  pitch deck and know the selling points of your business inside and out. According to DocSend‚Äôs data, although angel-led seed rounds are more common, firm-led rounds have  much more favorable characteristics. If you are able to raise funds from a firm, you‚Äôll get twice as much  money in 30 percent less time. You‚Äôll also need to contact only 40 percent as many investors.   The following summarizes the differences:  Avg time to fundraise (weeks) Avg investors contacted Avg investor meetings  $per contact  Firm Angel  0  Firm 9.6 29 27  Angel 13.5 68 45  $17,210  Firm  Angel  Avg money raised  $1,995,952  $989,118  % oversubscribed  36.8%  18.9%  $91,830  $100k  Our recommendation is to try raising from a Seed Fund first.  15  Series A vs Series Seed Rounds  Series A rounds are much less common than seed rounds. In DocSend‚Äôs data set, nine seed rounds  existed for every series A round. It appears that the Series A Crunch is still in effect. Although we have  fewer data points, we managed to collect some statistics on the differences between seed and A rounds.  If you are able to raise a Series A round, the process is easier than for a seed round. A rounds take less  time, yield more money, and require fewer investors than seed rounds.  Here are some of the key facts we gathered:  26investors  During A rounds,   companies contacted   an average of 26  investors, versus 58  investors contacted  for seed rounds.  9.6weeks  Series A rounds  took an average  of 9.6 weeks, 24  percent less time  than the time given   for the average  seed round.  16  30  investor meetings During A rounds,  companies had on  average 30 investor  meetings, versus 40  investor meetings for   seed rounds.  $1.3million  The average money  raised during seed  rounds was just  under $1.3 million,  where the money  raised during A  rounds was more  than $8 million.  Easiest Markets for Seed Funding   The following are some of the key statistics on the fundraising  efforts of the four types of business models:  Consumer  Business  Marketplace  Hardware  % deals  32%  M 2 $  32%  22%  avg $ raised  14%  $945,870  $1,245,435  $1,738,750  $1,330,000  Consumers‚Äô needs and other  economic conditions impact which  business models receive the  greatest success during fundraising.  While trends are always fluctuating,  in the past 12 months, four types of  companies stood out as having the  most success during seed rounds:  consumer, business, marketplace,  and hardware. On average, marketplace  companies raised the most money  in their seed rounds. Successful  marketplace businesses are quite  rare, but when they work, they‚Äôre  also much bigger, like Uber or  Airbnb. Raising money for a  marketplace startup takes a long  time. Although there‚Äôs a lot of money  for companies in these categories,  convincing investors that your  startup is going to win takes longer.  17  To Recap, Seven Key Takeaways  Fundraising for your startup can be an opaque and  frustrating process when the future of your business  is on the line. Keep these take aways in mind to  maximize your chances of successfully raising a  seed round.  Keep your deck to 20 pages or  fewer. Each visit will only be 3m  44sec on average.  20-30  Raising seed funding will take  longer than you think. Don‚Äôt start  to despair until you‚Äôve been at it  for a few months.  Try to raise from a seed firm  before you go to angels. Firms  will give you more money in  less time with fewer meetings.   1  2  3  20  18  More meetings does not equal  more money. Focus on getting  quality introductions to investors  who are likely to be a fit. Quality  over quantity.  You‚Äôll likely need to contact 20-30  investors. But you won‚Äôt need to  contact hundreds.  Spend time on your deck.  Specifically, make sure your  team slide looks awesome. If you  include a financial slide, which is  optional, remember it‚Äôll be your  most viewed.  Don‚Äôt list your deal terms in your  deck. Deliver them in person.  The terms can vary by investor.  4  5  6  7  Wondering what happens   after you raise a seed   round of funding?  Want to see who reads your  pitch deck and where they   spend time?

elwafeyat,"‚Äú   is the (cid:31)rst online  platform for obituaries, memorials   and condolences  ‚Äù  Announcing the death of a close family member is  physically difficult, emotionally painful and socially  awkward.  The process is inconvenient for both the family  and their network of friends.  PROBLEM  Family  Friends  It‚Äôs culturally very important for  families to honour their loved  ones and instantly get the news  out,  families either have to post in  newspapers or they rely on infor- mal tools.  Newspaper annunce- ments are extremely expensive,  inconvenient, and no longer have  the expected wide reach.  While  social media and other informal  tools lack value and don‚Äôt neces- sarily reach the right people.  Friends have to get informed on  time and attend the funeral. They  do not have the right tools to send  condolences and support the  family during their hardship. They  can post in the newspapers, send  telegrams or use informal tools.  Newspaper condolences are  extremely expensive and do not  reach everyone. Telegrams are  inconvenient and informal tools  are irrelevant.   - We decided to start with the Middle East as an entry point and then scale globally. It‚Äôs a very under utilised  region with untapped opportunities.   - Arabs publish obituaries and condolences in hard copy newspapers because it‚Äôs the only available platform.  - Our market is composed of those who post obituaries (creators) and people who want to know who passed  away to send condolences (subscribers)  - Taking Egypt as an example, 0.5m people die every year. Because newspapers are costly and don‚Äôt have a wide  reach ( less than 4% penetration), only 4.7k obituaries are posted annually (1% of deaths). The average price of  the post is as high as $1.5k. Our model allows us to acquire a bigger share of  the already big market due to  a(cid:30)ordably and convenience by targeting a wider social classes.  - As for subscribers we are targeting the wider Arabic speaking population who want to stay up to date and  send condolences. This market is as big as 300m out of which more than 45% are internet users and could be  potential customers.  - The market is similar not only in other Arab countries but in African and Central Asian, so the model could be  replicated and tailored for such markets  The services we o(cid:30)er are divided  into three main pillars  Announcing the death  and honoring the person:   -  Online obituaries  - Email obituaries  - App announcements - SMS shots   By integrating our service with  social networks we easily map out  people‚Äôs social connections to  automatically notify them when a  match is made.  Sending Condolences:   Process Facilitation:  People can pay their respects  through innovative:  - Online condolences  - Personalised letters, flowers, and  packages - Online initiatives to raise money  for a charitable cause in the name  of the deceased.  We offer a directory of offline  service providers and a guide to  the steps that need to be taken  when someone passes away. - Mosques - Churches - Publications and florists - Funeral services providers  Customer Acquisition  Co-Founder, Strategy Advisor  Co-Founder, Digital Marketing   Advisor  Technical Advisor  ‚Äú  We aim to become the number one go-to  place for all all post-death interactions in  structured and build architectured networks to  to keep everyone always connected during our  hardest times.

Marketers spend too much time preparing  and combining reports from multiple platforms.  Report creation and analysis requires standardizing data from multiple platforms and manually  uploading it into data visualization tools or spreadsheets.  With over 3,800 Martech platforms on the market, there is no solution to aggregate data  and performance without a team of developers or manual ETL process  Solution  Aggregate Advertising Data in Any Visualization Tool in Minutes  Save Time and Money: Free up development resources. Marketers no longer have to depend on developers to create  api integrations, maintain databases, or query data.  Cutting Edge Technology: It's nearly impossible to combine  data from all Martech platforms without our technology.  Two types of data exist in our market: 1) Log type of data and  2) API data, and we've built a unique approach to accomodate both.   ETL  Experienced Team: We are experts in MarTech with over 20 years  of combined experience in Marketing within our core founding team.

All of the current ETL providers don't support most Martech platforms.   Instead, they tend to be very broad in their focus for example CRM platforms, databases,  payments, or emails.  ‚Ä¢ Reporting platforms focus on selling their data visualization tools, and there are 1000s  of visualization tools in the market. We realize it's nearly impossible to build the perfect  visualization tool to meet each agency or brands unique needs, so we give them their data  via 3rd party servers.  ‚Ä¢ We can combine log data and API data which most reporting platforms are not currently doing.  We are a customer driven   product and team   has evolved based on our customer‚Äôs needs.

The assumptions used above fall within general macro statistics or have been reasonably adjusted for customer type. E.g., average shipments by internet sellers is 7/year;  we adjusted to 24 to account for greater power seller concentration. Average shipments per e-commerce store is 2,319; we used a  significantly more conservative estimate of 120. We also used a more conservative average shipment cost estimate; average industry  shipment spend per package is between R$30-R$50.  First-year monthly forecast  Five-year projections  Key modeling assumptions  ÔÇß General pricing assumptions assume average shipping revenue / item of R$ 20 (with 6% annual   inflation increases), plus a R$10  pickup fee for 1-item orders  ÔÇß Customer segment assumptions:  -  Individuals: 3 shipments / year, 75% utilization of Manda√™, 33% annual attrition rate, 1.1 items  per pickup, R$ 32 in revenues per pickup. CPA of between R$ 2 and R$ 5.  - Online sellers: 24 shipments / year, 90% utilization of Manda√™, 33% annual attrition rate, 1.8   items per pickup, 1.1 visits per month, R$ 40 in revenues per pickup. CPA of R$ 5.  - E-commerce: 120 shipments / year, 90% utilization of Manda√™, 50% annual attrition rate, 2.9   items per pickup, 3.5 visits per month, R$ 58 in revenues per pickup. CPA of R$ 5.  ÔÇß Shipping costs conservatively calculated using standard contract pricing tables published by the   Correios (Brazil‚Äôs postal service)  - Costs are based on published contract tables, not hypothetical volume discounts  - Costs decrease quickly with incremental volume increases  - Our aggregate shipping costs will vary depending on the shipment destinations. We used   conservative assumptions, meaning we assumed unfavorable routes and discounts. We  anticipate that in reality, we‚Äôll be able to realize higher cost-savings than what‚Äôs assumed in our  financial plan.  Thank you!

At one point, Rand + Gillian had just under $500K in personal debt.  By 2007, it was all paid off, thanks to the magical super-awesomeness of SEO!  2011 will be our first 8   figure year, and we   maintain margins of 83%+  Monthly  Visits  We took one round of   financing in 2007; $1.1MM  from Ignition + Curious Office  April of 2011, we   hit 1.2+MM   visits/month and  10K+ subscribers  In 2009, we dropped  consulting entirely  More about our history   How‚Äôd We Do That?  News/Media/PR  SEO  Email  Blogs + Blogging  Research/White Papers  Comment Marketing  Online Video  Forums  INBOUND MARKETING!

Although we believe that the plans, intentions, expectations, assumptions and strategies reÔ¨Çected in these forward-looking statements are  reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future Ô¨Ånancial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors  that  may  cause  our  actual  results  to  be  materially  diÔ¨Äerent  from  any  future  results  expressed  or  implied  by  these  forward-looking  statements.  Although  the  forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions, investors are cautioned against placing  undue reliance on these statements since actual results may vary from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown  risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially aÔ¨Äect our results. These risks are described in  further detail in the section entitled ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù and elsewhere in our Ô¨Ålings with regulatory agencies. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if  our  underlying  assumptions  prove  to  be  incorrect,  actual  results  may  vary  signiÔ¨Åcantly  from  those  implied  or  projected  by  the  forward-looking  statements.  References  to  long-term  trends  in  our  model  are  forward-looking  and  made  as  of  the  current  date.  Nothing  in  this  presentation  should  be  regarded  as  a  representation by any person that these long- term trends will be achieved and we undertake no duty to update its long-term trends.    We believe that the case studies presented in this presentation provide a representative sample of how our merchants have been able to use various features of  our platform to grow their respective businesses. References in this presentation to increased visits, growth and sales following implementation of our platform do  not necessarily mean that our platform was the only factor contributing to such increases.    To supplement the Ô¨Ånancial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use non-GAAP Ô¨Ånancial measures that  exclude certain items. Non-GAAP Ô¨Ånancial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other  companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Unfortunately, many companies  are unable to extract value and insight from their  data. AI will change that, and deep learning is at  the forefront of AI. With production-grade deep  learning tools, enterprise teams can learn from  their data more quickly, responding to the world  in real-time.  TURNING  DATA  INTO VALUE  Recent  breakthroughs in big data analysis and  AI  have  improved  our  ability  to  build  neural  networks  that  can  process  massive  amounts  of raw and unlabeled data. Because of this, we  can  achieve  accuracy  higher  than  ever  before,  a  revolution  that  will  sweep  across  many  industries.  Year  after  year,  deep  learning  is  pushing AI into new territory, breaking accuracy  records and leading to new products.  ‚Äú  3   DEEP  LEARNING  MACHINES THAT PERCEIVE THE WORLD  Deep learning  is the fastest-growing and most advanced field in machine learning.  It uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to find patterns in unstructured data such as  images, sound, video and text.  Deep learning has achieved record breaking performance on widely used datasets  such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. In many competitions, the only algorithm deep learning  competes against is itself.  4  Deep Learning for EnterpriseUSE CASES  Deep learning  is used to solve the hardest problems i n machine intelligence.

All Skymind products, such as DL4J, ND4J,  DavaVec, JavaCPP and Arbiter are 100% open-source and maintained by the most   active deep learning community in existence.  is   Deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j  the  first  commercial-grade,  open-source,  distributed  deep-learning  library  written  for  Java  and  Scala.  Integrated with Hadoop and Spark, DL4J is specifically designed to  be used in business environments on distributed GPUs and CPUs.  ND4J: Numpy for the JVM ND4J is a scientific computing library for the JVM. It‚Äôs Numpy for  Java and Scala. It is built for efficiency in production environments,  not as a research tool, so routines are designed to run fast with  minimum RAM requirements.  DataVec DataVec is an Apache 2.0 licensed open-source tool for machine  learning ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The goal of  DataVec is to transform and preprocess raw data into usable  vector formats across machine learning tools.  Arbiter A tool dedicated to evaluating and tuning machine learning  models. Part of the DL4J Suite of Machine Learning / Deep  Learning tools for the enterprise.   8  Deep Learning for EnterpriseFIRST COMMERCIAL-GRADE,  OPEN-SOURCE, DISTRIBUTED   DEEP LEARNING LIBRARY  Deeplearning4j is the most widely used open-source deep learning tool   for the JVM. Its aim is to bring deep learning to the production stack,  integrating tightly with popular big data frameworks like Hadoop and   Spark.  Skymind‚Äôs suite of tools takes advantage of the latest distributed computing  frameworks including Hadoop and Apache Spark to improve model training.  Deep learning excels at identifying patterns in unstructured data.   This includes images, sound, time series and text.  SOUND  TEXT  TIME SERIES  IMAGE  VIDEO  9   We‚Äôre  often  asked  why  we  chose  to  implement  an  open-source  deep  learning  project  in  Java,  when so much of the deep-learning community  is focused on Python. And the answers are speed   and security for enterprise deployment.  WRITE ONCE, RUN EVERYWHERE  Java‚Äôs  popularity  is  only  strengthened  by  its  ecosystem.  Most  enterprises  use  Java  or  a  JVM- based big data system. Hadoop is implemented  in  Java;  Spark  runs  within  Hadoop‚Äôs  Yarn  run- time; libraries like Akka made building distributed   systems for Deeplearning4j feasible.  10  Deep Learning for EnterpriseCERTIFIED ON   CLOUDERA AND HORTONWORKS  INTEGRATING SEAMLESSLY WITH  NVIDIA, INTEL AND IBM  11   ADVANTAGES  FEATURE RICH, FAST, ACCURATE AND EASY TO DEPLOY  24/7 SUPPORT BY  OUR COMMUNITY  INCLUDES ALL MAJOR   NEURAL NETS  SCALABLE  ULTRA FAST  PERFORMANCE  HIGH ACCURACY  COMPATIBLE WITH   ALL MAJOR SYSTEMS   12  Deep Learning for EnterpriseOUR DEEP LEARNING ECOSYSTEM  DEVELOPING, TRAINING AND TUNING YOUR MODEL  HADOOP HDFS Data Sources  DL4J  Modeling  ARBITER  Model Evaluation  DATAVEC  Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) Data  DATAVEC  Vectorization  ND4J  Linear Algebra Runtime: CPU, GPU  13   SKIL¬Æ  THE  SKYMIND INTELLIGENCE LAYER - DEEP LEARNING IN  PRODUCTION  R  SKIL is Skymind‚Äôs proprietary enterprise distribution.

Using  an  artificial  neural  network  (ANN)  called  an autoencoder, Orange Silicon Valley analyzes call detail  records (CDRs) to find patterns that identify fraud. The ANN  also predicts the likelihood that an instance is fraudulent.  Where a static rule system flags cases only as likely fraud  or not, the ANN enables Orange‚Äôs analysts to prioritize  high probability cases of SIM Box fraud.  ‚ÄúThe problem is that fraud moves so quickly that it has  been difficult for Orange‚Äôs static algorithms to detect  it,‚Äù told by Georges Nahon, CEO of Orange Silicon Valley  19   SKYMIND INC.
